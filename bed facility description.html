<h1>BED FACILITY</h1>
   <h3> A hospital bed or hospital cot is a bed specially designed for hospitalized patients or others in need of some form of health care. These beds have special features both for the comfort and well-being of the patient and for the convenience of health care workers. Common features include adjustable height for the entire bed, the head, and the feet, adjustable side rails, and electronic buttons to operate both the bed and other nearby electronic devices.

Hospital beds and other similar types of beds such as nursing care beds are used not only in hospitals, but in other health care facilities and settings, such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, outpatient clinics, and in home health care.

While the term "hospital bed" can refer to the actual bed, the term "bed" is also used to describe the amount of space in a health care facility, as the capacity for the number of patients at the facility is measured in available "beds."</h3>

<h3>
WHO defines a hospital bed as a bed that is regularly maintained and staffed for the
accommodation and full-time care of a succession of inpatients and is situated in
wards or a part of the hospital where continuous medical care for inpatients is
provided. The total of such beds constitutes the normally available bed complement
of the hospital.
Counts of available hospital beds exclude cots for neonates, day care beds,
provisional and temporary beds, beds in storerooms, and beds for special purposes
such as dialysis or delivery (WHO, 2000a).
The OECD Health Data currently avoids the term “hospital beds” and uses the term
“in-patient beds”. These are further sub classified into “curative care beds” or “acute
care beds”, “psychiatric care beds” and “long-term care beds”. EUROSTAT has
introduced another subgroup i.e. “other beds”.
In-patient hospital care beds accommodate patients who are formally admitted (or
‘hospitalised’) to a hospital for treatment and/or care and who stay for a minimum of
one night in the hospital. Beds in hospitals available for same day or day-care
patient care are usually not included in figures for “total inpatient care beds”. Counts
of total inpatient care beds refer to counts of “available beds”.</h3>
