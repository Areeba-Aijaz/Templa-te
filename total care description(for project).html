<h1>TOTAL CARE</h1>
<p>Total Care recognizes doctors that focus on health care instead of sick care. These doctors go above and beyond to enhance the overall health of their patients, providing preventive services and wellness coaching, as well as working with patients with chronic conditions to better meet their care needs. TotalCare is coordinated, patient-focused and, in many cases, more affordable healthcare.</p>
