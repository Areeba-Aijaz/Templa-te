    <h3>You should get a COVID-19 test if:</h3>
    <li>You have new symptoms such as fatigue, headache, body/muscle aches, cough, fever, sore throat, and/or congestion.</li>
<li>You have symptoms and are at high risk for severe illness because of other medical conditions, age, or have a compromised immune system. You may qualify for treatment to reduce your risk of severe illness.</li>
 

<h3>Consider getting tested if:</h3>
<li>You had a known exposure to someone with COVID 2-5 days ago, especially if you are unvaccinated.</li>
 

<h3>Given how extremely contagious the Omicron variant is, if you have symptoms of COVID-19 and cannot get tested:</h3>
<li>Assume you have COVID-19and follow isolation guidelines.</li>
<li>If members of your household are having similar symptoms, and at least one of them tests positive for COVID-19, you can probably assume that all members have COVID-19.</li>
 

<h3>Do not get a PCR test if:</h3>
<li>You’ve tested positive in the last 90 days.</li>
<li>You have already tested positive with a rapid home test.</li>
<li>You need a negative test to end isolation early (for that, use a rapid home/antigen test).
    Please do not come to the Emergency Room if you ONLY need a COVID-19 test.</li>
 

<h3>Testing is a Critical Tool in the Fight Against COVID-19</h3>
Widespread testing provides a more accurate picture of how many cases exist in our community and helps us understand how and where the virus is spreading. Testing helps identify people without symptoms who could be spreading COVID-19 so that they can stay away from work and public places until their infectious period is over. While turnaround times are 1-3 days on average, we cannot guarantee, prioritize or otherwise expedite result for travel or other purposes. We also cannot guarantee that your report will meet all requirements for domestic or international travel.

 


<h3>Your Testing Rights: </h3>
You have a right to be tested by your Provider, for more information please see the Updated Public Health Testing Order here. This requires Providers to test people who have symptoms, were exposed to someone who tested positive, are referred by the Santa Clara County Public Health Department to their healthcare provider for COVID-19 testing, and are essential workers (including teachers, healthcare workers, grocery store clerks, and workers in agriculture or food manufacturing).
